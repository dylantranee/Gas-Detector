# Gas Detector

## Description
A real-time gas leakage detection system using an MQ2 gas sensor and Arduino NANO. It triggers alerts via LED and buzzer when dangerous gas levels are detected.

## Components Used
- MQ2 Gas Sensor
- Arduino NANO
- LED
- Buzzer
- Custom PCB Design

## How to Use
- Connect the MQ2 sensor to the Arduino NANO as per the circuit diagram.
- Upload the firmware code to the Arduino NANO using the Arduino IDE.
- Power the system and monitor the gas detection alerts.
